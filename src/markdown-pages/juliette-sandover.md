</div>

**Juliette Anais Sandover**, called **Julie** by friends, is the best friend of Madeline Harbour and acts as a detective assistant within her group. Juliette is a young woman who was born in the Isle of Tranquility. She is the daughter and youngest child of Bernadette Sandover.

Juliette has a hardy personality and is typically abrasive to people she does not trust. This trait often leads to her getting the team in trouble but sometimes provides a sharp edge to the team in certain situations. Juliette is fiercly loyal to Madeline specifically and will always do what she thinks is best for her - even if it might not be the best decision.

##Background
Juliette is a member of the Sandover family, one of the most powerful political families in the Serenity Archipelago. Despite this, Juliette herself seems to avoid talking about her family and prestige. This stems from a very tense relationship between Juliette and her elder sister, Violette Sandover.

Sometime during her childhood, she met Madeline Harbour and the two became best friends after Madeline 'saved' Juliette from an encounter with Jimmy Jarvis. During this encounter, Juliette was injured and had her broken bones repaired with titanium plating - earning her the nickname 'Sassy Steel'.

Juliette is rarely seen with her parents and barely mentions them. She is extremely against telling anyone about her status as a 'princess' of the Sandover family. When Madeline Harbour asks for her help in her newly formed detective team - Juliette agrees despite her doubts.

##Personality and Traits

Juliette can be described as sarcastic and sassy but fiercly loyal and caring. Juliette tends to show a 'hardier' side to those she is not fond of or who she has recently met. This often gives people the impression that she is 'rude' - something she takes great issue with since most of her sassy remarks are made with a hint of playfulness rather than malice.

In her interactions with Madeline, Juliette shows a softer side - caring deeply for her best friend's emotional and physical well-being. Juliette greatly respects Madeline and seems to be the only person she will bend to if asked. Juliette seems to be confident in who she is and rarely tries to change who she is in order to fit other people's standards or the situation. This confidence often leads to sticky situations, since Juliette tends to not hold her tounge even in dangerous situations unless Madeline is there to rein her in.

Juliette is able to recognize when someone is distressed or sad and is able to switch between her sassy and brash side to her more caring and empathetic side. This is mostly visible in her interactions with Maxine Rubin because the two women will often be at odds with each other but Juliette will sometimes talk to Maxine in a more caring, friendly way.

##Appearance and Physical
Juliette has a tanned skin tone and reddish-brown shoulder length hair that curls in multiple directions. Juliette suggests that her hairstyle is not 'messy' and is a personal stylistic choice. Juliette has brown eyes with freckles underneath them. She wears winged eyeliner whenever she is out in the city.

Juliette wears athletic clothing for the most part. Her outfits can consist of hoodies, leggings, shorts, compression clothing, sweatpants, and sweatshirts. Juliette tends to avoid wearing dresses or skirts. Juliette is oftentimes wearing a lone piece of jewelry which Madeline notes is of the most expensive kind. She will often wear one earring (pearl or gold hoop) on her left ear or wear some sort of bracelet on one arm.

Juliette leads a very active lifestyle and usually spends her free time running or kick-boxing. As a result, Juliette is very fit and usually plays a critical role in the team's physical confrontations. Due to her body being reinforced with titanium plating Juliette is capable of dishing out powerful kicks and can endure much more abuse than Madeline or Julian. Like Madeline, Juliette is able to perform acrobatic manuevers, albeit with more difficulty.

##Biography

###Early Life

Juliette Sandover was born on January 3rd to Bernadette and Alistair Sandover at the Citadel on the island city of Northern Serenity.
Juliette's older sister, Violette would babysit Juliette and become very close and caring to Juliette during their childhoods.

###Jimmy and Patrick

Juliette would endure a long-term bullying campagin brought about by Jimmy Jarvis and his friend Patrick Weaver. Together the two would physically abuse Juliette due to her tendency to fight back. Jimmy claimed that Juliette was his favorite target due to the 'challenge' she presented and that he always held his punches out of a fear that she would move away or get hospitalized. This made it extremely difficult for Juliette to prove anything and get help from other adults.
One day, Juliette broke and shattered Patrick's nose with a stapler that she threw at his head. Juliette attempted to escape the two boys but was eventually caught by Jimmy at a secluded basketball court. Juliette's fight with Jimmy resulted in Jimmy losing his cool and overpowering Juliette and procceeding to systemically and creully break the bones in the left side of her body. Patrick grew afraid of Jimmy's creulty and ran away, leaving Juliette alone with Jimmy.

As Jimmy debated whether or not to kill Juliette, a young Madeline Harbour confronted Jimmy and took a punch to the face. This resulted in Clarissa Harbour's arrival at the scene, where she managed to chase away Jimmy and ferry both Juliette and Madeline to the hospital. During her hospital stay, Madeline would visit Juliette and the two would become close friends.
