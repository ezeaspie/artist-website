</div>

**Juliette Anais Sandover**, called **Julie** by friends, is the best friend of Madeline Harbour and acts as a detective assistant within her group. Juliette is a young woman who was born in the Isle of Tranquility. She is the daughter and youngest child of Violet Sandover.

Juliette has a hardy personality and is typically abrasive to people she does not trust. This trait often leads to her getting the team in trouble but sometimes provides a sharp edge to the team in certain situations. Juliette is fiercly loyal to Madeline specifically and will always do what she thinks is best for her - even if it might not be the best decision.

##Background
Juliette is a member of the Sandover family, one of the most powerful political families in the Serenity Archipelago. Despite this, Juliette herself seems to avoid talking about her family and prestige. 

Sometime during her childhood, she met Madeline Harbour and the two became best friends after Madeline 'saved' Juliette from an encounter with Jimmy Jarvis. During this encounter, Juliette was injured and had her broken bones repaired with titanium plating - giving her the nickname 'Sassy Steel'.

Juliette is rarely seen with her parents and barely mentions them. When Madeline Harbour asks for her help in her newly formed detective team - Juliette agrees despite her doubts.

##Personality

Juliette can be described as sarcastic and sassy but fiercly loyal and caring. Juliette tends to show a 'hardier' side to those she is not fond of or who she has recently met. This often gives people the impression that she is 'rude' - something she takes great issue with since most of her sassy remarks are made with a hint of playfulness rather than malice.

In her interactions with Madeline, Juliette shows a softer side - caring deeply for her best friend's emotional and physical well-being. Juliette greatly respects Madeline and seems to be the only person she will bend to if asked. Juliette seems to be confident in who she is and rarely tries to change who she is in order to fit other people's standards or the situation. This confidence often leads to sticky situations, since Juliette tends to not hold her tounge even in dangerous situations unless Madeline is there to rein her in.

##Appearance and Physical
Juliette has a tanned skin tone and has brown shoulder length hair that curls in multiple directions. Juliette suggests that her hairstyle is not 'messy' and is a personal stylistic choice. Juliette has brown eyes with freckles underneath them. She wears winged eyeliner whenever out in the city.

Juliette wears athletic clothing for the most part. Her outfits can consist of hoodies, leggings, shorts, compression clothing, sweatpants, and sweatshirts. Juliette tends to avoid wearing dresses or skirts.

Juliette leads a very active lifestyle and usually spends her free time running or kick-boxing. As a result, Juliette is very fit and usually plays a critical role in the team's physical confrontations. Due to her body being reinforced with titanium plating Juliette is capable of dishing out powerful kicks and can endure much more abuse than Madeline or Julian. Like Madeline, Juliette is able to perform acrobatic manuevers, albeit with more difficulty.
