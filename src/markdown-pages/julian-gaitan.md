**Julian Gaitan Garcia**, called **Jules** by Madeline, is a close friend of Madeline Harbour and acts as a detective assistant within her group - focusing mainly on recordkeeping. Julian is a young man who was born in the La Noria neighborhood of Northern Serenity.

Juliette has a hardy personality and is typically abrasive to people she does not trust. This trait often leads to her getting the team in trouble but sometimes provides a sharp edge to the team in certain situations. Juliette is fiercly loyal to Madeline specifically and will always do what she thinks is best for her - even if it might not be the best decision.
