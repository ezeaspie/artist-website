Lieutenant **Maxine Amelia Rubin** is a young officer within the Northern Serenity Police Department. During the events of *The Ring of Deceit* arc, she forms an unofficial duo with Officer Damien Schmidt. Maxine is touted as a rising star within the department and is one of the youngest officers to reach the Sergeant and then Lieutenant rank. 

Maxine's devotion to her personal definition of the NSPD's motto - 'For Justice and the Greater Good' - cause her to be in constant conflict with the NSPD's top officers and lower ranks when they do not share the same sentiment towards their goals. Maxine is headstrong, usually taking matters into her own hands and speaking exactly what is on her mind - regardless of ranking or respect.

Maxine has an intense hatred of criminals, stemming from her childhood where she witnessed her mother Veronica Rubin get killed at the hands of Rust Bandit Commander 'Drill'. Since then, Maxine has sought revenge against Drill but also towards any criminals she encounters. Damien typically has to reel Maxine in as she has a tendency to use excessive force when heated.

##Background

Maxine was born in the Chantilly neighborhood of Northern Serenity to Caspar and Veronica Rubin. She lives in her childhood home with her father Caspar. Maxine was born in a middle-class neighborhood that was the location of constant clashes between the NSPD and the gangs of the West.

During her childhood, Maxine grew to love her father's work as a police scientist and her mother's philosophy towards criminals. Maxine would gain an understanding of the criminal justice system and the flaws with Northern Serenity since her mother was the District Attorney. Veronica Rubin would be killed at the hands of the Rust Bandits, causing Maxine to join the NSPD with the intent of seeking indivdual revenge and carrying on a warped version her mother's 'Justice'.

Maxine excelled in physical and traditional tests - enabling her to become a cadet early on. Her devotion and drive to stop criminals quickly caught the attention of higher ups, who would keep tabs on her. Maxine would go on to be promoted several times before the start of Heroine Rises - reaching the Lieutenant rank by the time Madeline Harbour confronts Damien Schmidht.

As Maxine's influence within the NSPD grows, so does opposition. Maxine's efforts to reform the department are constantly stifled by the higher-ups and as a result, she tries to recruit team members to help her with her goals.

##Personality and Traits

Maxine can be described as aggresive, cold, short-tempered, and extremely driven. Like her father Caspar, Maxine has become a part of the NSPD and is driven to be the best officer she can be - at the cost of a social life. Maxine's devotion to her goals with the NSPD have led her to have very little friends or hobbies outside of police work. This lonlieness affects Maxine deeply but she prefers to ignore her feelings and cope by doing more work or training. As a result, Maxine is usually high strung and short-tempered.

Maxine partially blames her father Caspar for Veronica's death and the two share an uneasy relationship as a result. Caspar does his best to be a good father but Maxine is very hard to impress and does not attempt to foster a close relationship with her only family. Clarissa Harbour has noted that Maxine does not know who or what was to blame for Veronica's death but chooses to cope with the event by blaming others. Clarissa also notes that Maxine might have re-imagined some of the memories she had of her mother's death and past, adjusting them so that they fit Maxine's worldview. 

While she never would admit, Maxine cares deeply for those who choose to remain involved in her life. Caspar, Juliette, and Damien are among the only people Maxine would secretly consider 'loved ones'. Maxine, when with people she likes, retains her sharp personality but is not actively trying to push them away. In contrast, when meeting with someone she does not care for, she will make every possible attempt to make that person go away, spoiling any situation with her anger and pettiness.

Maxine has a love for donuts and pastries, something that is often exploited as a comedic weakness by Damien, Juliette, or Caspar to get Maxine out of a bad mood or to get her to do something.

##Appearance

Maxine is a shorter woman with wavy red hair that she cuts above her shoulders. Maxine's hair is dyed red as her natural color is a lighter brown that she inherited from her father. Her eyes are a light brown, though they are often depicted as red in promotional art. Maxine has a short and round nose. Maxine's skin is a pale white that easily turns flush when angry, flustred, or in hot enviornments. The skin below Maxine's eyes is always flushed and slightly reddened at all times. Maxine has three distinct scars on the left side of her face, given to her by Rust Bandit Commander Drill at different times before the start of the *Heroine Rises* timeline.

Maxine is often wearing some variation of the NSPD uniform. Due to lax enforcement of the uniform policy, Maxine is able to customize her uniform which she does by adding a custom made light colored leather jackets atop variations of the NSPD uniform shirt. While she does not wear the exact same outfit everyday, Maxine often wears slight variations of the jacket/shirt combination. She wears dark colored pants and appears to be very fond of calf and knee height boots that she wears in black or brown. In more dangerous situations, Maxine's outfit of choice consists of the ADIRA Rouge 1 Light Armor with various armor plates depending on the risk. After *FireStarter*, Maxine wears a set of Vulcan Armory Commander Armor in the highest risk situations.

Outside of the NSPD, Maxine does not seem to have a defined style and simply wears whatever she 'likes and feels' with no regard to style consistencies. When she is feeling 'cute' or 'casual', Maxine will wear pastel colors and is partial to a dress. She likes to wear an oversized bow on her head, a callback to her youth when her father would dress her. In more 'serious' moods, Maxine wears open leather jackets with jeans and boots, similar to her NSPD outfits in all but branding and color.
