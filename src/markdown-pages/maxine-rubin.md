**Maxine Amelia Rubin** is a Lieutenant within the Northern Serenity Police Department. She forms an unofficial duo with Officer Damien Schmidt. Maxine is a rising star within the department and is one of the youngest officers to reach the Sergeant and Lieutenant rank. 

Juliette has a hardy personality and is typically abrasive to people she does not trust. This trait often leads to her getting the team in trouble but sometimes provides a sharp edge to the team in certain situations. Juliette is fiercly loyal to Madeline specifically and will always do what she thinks is best for her - even if it might not be the best decision.
