Lieutenant **Maxine Amelia Rubin** is a young officer within the Northern Serenity Police Department. During the events of *The Ring of Deceit* arc, she forms an unofficial duo with Officer Damien Schmidt. Maxine is touted as a rising star within the department and is one of the youngest officers to reach the Sergeant and then Lieutenant rank. 

Maxine's devotion to her personal definition of the NSPD's motto - 'For Justice and the Greater Good' - cause her to be in constant conflict with the NSPD's top officers and lower ranks when they do not share the same sentiment towards their goals. Maxine is headstrong, usually taking matters into her own hands and speaking exactly what is on her mind - regardless of ranking or respect.

##Background

Maxine was born in the Chantilly neighborhood of Northern Serenity. She lives in her childhood home along with her father, NSPD Head Scientist Caspar Rubin. Maxine was born in a middle-class neighborhood that was the location of constant clashes between the NSPD and the gangs of the West.

During her childhood, Maxine grew to respect her father's work and her mother's philosophy towards criminals. Maxine's mother Veronica Rubin would eventually be killed at the hands of Rust Bandits, causing Maxine to join the NSPD with the intent of seeking indivdual revenge and carrying on her mother's vision of 'Justice' by reforming the police department.

Maxine excelled in physical and traditional tests - enabling her to become a cadet early on. Her devotion and drive to stop criminals quickly caught the attention of higher ups, who would keep tabs on her. Maxine would go on to be promoted several times before the start of Heroine Rises - reaching the Lieutenant rank by the time Madeline Harbour confronts Damien Schmidht. 

As Maxine's influence within the NSPD grows, so does opposition. Maxine's efforts to reform the department are constantly stifled by the higher-ups and as a result, she tries to recruit team members to help her with her goals.

##Personality

Maxine is often times very hostile and snappy with people who get in the way of her goals.
