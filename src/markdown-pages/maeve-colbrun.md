**Maeve Bethany Colbrun-Lassiter**, is an aristocratic woman who hails from the powerful Lima family. She is the first person to ask Madeline Harbour for help with a major case. Her stolen ruby ring kicks off the events of the *Serenity East* arc. Ada is the wife of Robert Silva and acts as a housewife.

Ada's past is spotty as she rarely seems to get her story straight - leading to confusion about how her childhood and youth went. Ada is very hospitable and friendly. She is very talkative and often goes on long-winded stories before answering questions. Ada is also quite forgetful and seems to constantly forget what she was doing or was planning to do.

##Background

Ada is a member of the Lima family, one of the most powerful political families in the Serenity Archipelago. She is a member of the de Santos branch of the family - which includes an unnamed mother, an unnamed father, a grandmother named Antoinetta Lima, and her siblings: Alfonso and Estefania Lima.

Ada is the youngest of her siblings and is the twin sister of Alfonso Lima. Ada admits she never was an 'example child' and was quite suprised when she was chosen as inheritor of the Ruby Ring over her sister Estefania.<sup><a href="https://www.ezequielespinoza.com/heroine-rises/4/8">[2]</a></sup> This decision appears to have led to schism between the three siblings and Robert Silva mentions that the three do not talk to each other.

During some point, Ada appears to have cared for babies and children<sup><a href="https://www.ezequielespinoza.com/heroine-rises/4/5">[3]</a></sup>

##Personality

Ada can be described as very sociable and friendly. She loves attending to guests and meeting new people and appears to see the good in almost everyone she meets. This is evident when Irene Lassiter mentions that Ada was the only person who looked past her criminal past and apperance to give her a well-paying job as a housekeeper.

Ada has a very talkative nature. She loves to spend time discussing everything and anything that comes to mind. She very often reveals personal or trusted information to others - even if they are complete strangers.

Ada spends her time maintaining the house and enjoys small social gatherings with other women in the neighborhood. Ada seems to enjoy gardening, painting, and cooking - all of which she is very skilled at. She is also very fond of tea and enjoys conversation over a hot drink.

##Appearance

Ada has olive colored skin and has an average build.
